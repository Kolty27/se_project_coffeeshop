# Triple Espresso — Coffee Shop Website

## Project Description

This project is a multi-section responsive website built as part of a web development project. It serves as the digital space of a fictional coffee shop called **Triple Espresso**, which is located in the Triple Peaks Library.

The site includes the following sections:

- **About Section** — provides details about the shop's mission, with layered design and animated graphics.

- **Recipes Section** — embeds YouTube tutorials on popular coffee-making techniques.

- **Menu Section** — displays an organized list of drinks and baked goods with pricing.

- **Book a Table Section** — includes a form for users to reserve a table with name, guest count, date/time, and email.

- **Footer** — includes social media links, branding, and copyright.

Technologies used:

- **HTML**

- **CSS (Flexbox, Positioning, Animations)**

- **Responsive Web Design**

- **BEM Methodology**

## Plans for Improving the Project

Here are a few ideas for future improvements:

1. **Database Integration**: Store reservation data in a backend (ex., Firebase) for a real-world scenario.

2. **Interactive Menu**: Add filters or categories to make the menu more interactive for users.

3. **Animations Expansion**: Add subtle animations to other sections, like hover effects on cards or transitions on the form.
